# Face-emotions

## One solution for Kaggle challenge ["Facial Expression Recognition Challenge"](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge)
This is project for course "Computational Intelligence" - Faculty of Mathematics, University of Belgrade.

### Project idea
Training deep learning model for classification problem of face emotions using pretrained face embeddings from library [face_recogntion](https://pypi.org/project/face_recognition/). All details in [paper](https://github.com/DenisAlicic/Face-emotions/blob/master/paper/emotions_recognizer.pdf)
